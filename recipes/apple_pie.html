    <h2 class="recipe-subheading">Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-description">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
    be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of
    your favorites as well! Serve hot or cold at family dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped
    cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.</p>
    
    <h3 class="recipe-subheading">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">

        <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>

        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>

        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>

        <li>¼ cup water</li>

        <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="recipe-subheading">Steps</h4>

    <ol class="steps-list">
        
        <li>Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until
        fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add bothn sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and
        simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>

        <li>Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it
        will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.</li>

        <li>Place sliced apples in the bottom crust, forming a slight mound.</li>

        <li>Lay four strips vertically and evenly spaced over top of the filled pie, using longer strips in the
        center and shorter strips at the edges.</li>

        <li>Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the
        unused strips perpendicular over the second and forth strips, then unfold the first and third strips
        back into their original position.</li>

        <li>Fold the second and forth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicular over
        top. Unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.</li>

        <li>Repeat Steps 7 and 8 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges
        as necessary, and pinch to secure.</li>

        <li>Slowly and gently pour the sugar-butter mixture over the crust, making sure it seeps down through the
        lattice and over the sliced apples. Brush some over the top of the lattice, but make sure it doesn't run
        off the sides.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and
        continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
