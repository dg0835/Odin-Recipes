    <h2 class="recipe-subheading">Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-description">Tasty tortilla chips baked at home with corn tortillas are much better than store-bought chips. With an
    amazing lime and cumin flavor, these crispy, golden chips taste great with your favorite salsa, guacamole,
    or hummus.</p>
    
    <h3 class="recipe-subheading">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">

        <li>1 (12 ounce) package corn tortillas</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

    </ul>

    <h4 class="recipe-subheading">Steps</h4>

    <ol class="steps-list">

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Stack tortillas in layers of 5 or 6. Cut through each stack to make 8 wedges. Arrange wedges in a single
        layer on rimmed baking sheets.</li>

        <li>Combine lime juice and oil in a spray bottle or mister; shake until well mixed. Spray the tops of the
        tortilla wedges until slightly moist.</li>

        <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, and salt in a small bowl; sprinkle mixture over the chips.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 7 minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven. Flip chips, then mist and season again.</li>

        <li>Return to the oven, rotating the pans and switching racks. Bake, checking often to ensure they don't
        burn, until chips are lightly browned and crisp, 5 to 8 more minutes.</li>

        <li>Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving. Chips will crisp up more as they cool.</li>

    </ol>
